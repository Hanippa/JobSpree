Your code demonstrates a good understanding of Django's model-view-controller (MVC) architecture and adheres to the recommended best practices.

Your models.py file is well-structured and effectively defines the database schema for your application.
The proper usage of Django's model fields, such as CharField, DateField, TextField, and ForeignKey, 
shows your familiarity with Django.

it is also great that you implemented 
user authentication and decorators like login_required. 
This ensures that only authenticated users can access certain views, adding a layer of security to your application.

Consider exploring Django's class-based views for a more streamlined and reusable approach to handling common view patterns.
